# Authenica


It is a comprehensive tool designed for generating and verifying digital certificates. The project allows users to create certificates and then validate their authenticity and integrity through a verification process. By cross-checking key details, the tool ensures that certificates meet predefined standards and are not forged or tampered with.

Users can generate certificates directly on the platform and verify them against trusted sources or rules, streamlining the validation process and reducing the risk of invalid certificates being used.
